;;; Commentary:

;; Provide `fancy-battery-mode', which is like `display-battery-mode' but with
;; fancier display, and more customization options.

;; Customize `fancy-battery-mode-line' to change the appearance of the battery
;; status information.  Take a look at `fancy-battery-default-mode-line' for the
;; default value and for inspiration.

;; Customize `mode-line-format' and `mode-line-misc-info' to change the position
;; at which the battery status appears in the mode line.  Typically it's at the
;; very end after the minor mode list, so you may want to move
;; `mode-line-misc-info` more to the front of `mode-line-format`.

use the cached status in `fancy-battery-last-status'."
